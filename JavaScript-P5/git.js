/*
    Today is for only some quick notes and refresh notes, all code will be given and all the explainations will be done, so dont worry!

    - var is used for local scope
    - global variables are properties on the window object
    - we can also declare variables using let and const, they allow us to create block level variables (block scope).
    - for example in if statements we can use let ("if is a block"), and the same goes for const.
    - the only different for const is that const won't let us change the value of the variable
