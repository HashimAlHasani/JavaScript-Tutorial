/*
An object will describe some entity (can be anything).

A constructor function takes some information as input and gives us an object.

In JS there is no real difference between classes and constructor functions when 
it comes to functionality and the way they are used, they are different when
it comes to syntax and how you actually make them.

The constructor function is going to use this keyword - when you use the this keyword 
inside of a constructor function it is refers to the new object you are creating.

The constructor function is not going to have a return, instead you`ll going 
to invoke this function in a special way by prefixing it with "new" - let person = new Person();
