    //IIFE - immediately invoked function expression
    var age = 5;
    //if we don't have the var keyword it will look for the "age" variable from the parent or outer scope.
})(); //This () tells it to execute
//This set of () says that this is an expression and not just a function declaration (the bracket starting before the word function)

//It is okay to not understand what is going on right now, later on we will go into much more smaller details, and these JS-Parts
//are just to familiarise you with the code syntax
