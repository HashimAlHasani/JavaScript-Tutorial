// Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type, 
// making the code more flexible and reusable. There are two main types of polymorphism in JavaScript: 
// compile-time polymorphism (also known as static polymorphism) and 
// runtime polymorphism (also known as dynamic polymorphism).
